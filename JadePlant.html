       <p>Aloe vera, commonly referred to as the savior of sunburnt skin. Aloe plants can be grown indoors and outdoors, part of how they're versatile and low maintenance. This makes aloe vera a common household plant.
    </p>
       <ul> 
    <h2>steps:</h2>
    <li>step 1 : planting</li>
    <p>Fill your pot with soil to about 1/4 inch of the top. Press the surface to make it even and squeeze out any trapped air. Lay out the aloe seeds about 1 to 1 and a half inches apart on the surface of the sandy mixture. Push the seeds into the surface of the mixture and cover the seeds with a very thin layer of sand. Water it deeply, but infrequently. To discourage rot. Don't let your plant sit in water. Water about every 3 weeks and even more sparingly during the winter.</p>
    <li>step 2 : condition</li>
    <p>aloe vera plants need plenty of sunlight, minimal regular watering and warm temperatures. Aloe vera plants are drought resistant, so they can survive with minimal watering. It is critical that you place your aloe in a window where it will receive a minimum of six hours of sunlight per day.</p>
    <li>step 3 : additional care </li>
    <p>If the tips of your Aloe Vera plant are turning brown, you can cut them off without harming your plant.</p>
    <p> When you're watering an aloe vera plant, always water it from the bottom. Pour the water in slowly until it starts to emerge from the drainage holes under the pot. Make sure that the pot has plenty of drainage holes. Aloe vera plants cannot tolerate standing water.</p>
</ul>
    
    <h2>Tips For Healthier Plants</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Tip 1. Aloe plants in full sun have the best chance of blooming.</li>
        <li>Tip 2. A common indication of improper watering is black spots on the leaves due to overwatering. Overwatering can be more dangerous than under watering because it could lead to root rot.</li>
        <li>Tip 3. Not watering your aloe vera plant will shorten its lifespan.</li>
        <li>Tip 4. Like cacti, succulents do best in dry conditions. When growing aloe vera plants, plant them in a cactus potting soil mix or a regular potting soil that has been amended with additional perlite or building sand.</li>
