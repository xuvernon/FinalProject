    <h1>Wondering how to grow Sunflowers?</h1>

    <p>Nothing says summer like bright rows of brilliant sunflowers. Often seen as a border plant to give height to the back of a flower bed, sunflowers are multipurpose flowers. They provide beauty to your garden and are a food source for birds and squirrels.    </p>
        <ul> 
<h2>Steps:</h2>
<li>Step 1: Planting</li>
<p>Planting sunflower seeds is a quick and easy task. By taking the time to choose the right location and preparing the soil. Plant sunflowers in late Spring, once the ground is nice and warm. Plant sunflower seeds at least 1/2 an inch deep in soil spaced 6 inches apart. If planting in rows, you'll want 2 to 3 feet between each row. After planting, water the ground thoroughly.</p>
<li>Step 2: Condition</li>
<p>Look for a spot with plenty of sun and well-draining soil. Sunflowers do not need daily water. They should have 1 inch (down the soil) of water each week.  </p>
<li>Step 3: Additional Care </li>
<p>Once the sunflower seedlings have their first set of true leaves, thin the seedlings to the recommended row spacing for your variety. Small sunflowers may require only 6 inches between each plant, while large varieties might need up to 3 feet. </p>
<p>One of the greatest sunflower challenges is weed control. Weeds compete with sunflowers for moisture and nutrition. Unless you want to pull weeds by hand, you will want to put down a generous layer of mulch to fight weeds. 	</p>    
</ul>

    <h2>Tips For A Healthier Plant</h2>
    <li>Think about what you will plant around or near your sunflowers. Most sunflowers grow quite tall and may cast shade on other plants.</li>
    <li>If your soil is heavy, mix in up to 4 inches of compost. Add nutrients to soil with a complete fertilizer prior to planting..</li>
    <li>Because sunflower seeds contain large amounts of natural oil, they require a lot of watering.</li>
    <li>If you prepare your soil with compost and/or manure, you should not need extra fertilization during the growing season.</li>
</ol>
