    <h1>Wondering how to grow Crocus?</h1>

    <p>Crocuses might be small flowers, but they carry a powerful message: Spring is around the corner! Blooming in yellow, white, purple, lilac and even orange, these hardy little fellows are a delightful start to the flower bulb season.</p>
        <ul> 
<h2>Steps:</h2>
<li>Step 1: Planting </li>
<p>Crocuses need a cold period to develop their roots and get ready for Spring. So once you feel fall's first chill in the air, it's time to get planting. Water them once after planting and moderately in Spring.</p>
<li>Step 2: Condition </li>
<p>Pick a spot in your garden that has well-draining soil and gets full sun or partial shade. Plant the crocus bulbs about 2 to 3 inches deep and 3 inches apart, placing them in the ground with their pointy ends up. Water well once and wait for Spring. After the crocuses have bloomed don not cut off the foliage.</p>
<li>Step 3: Additional Care </li>
<p>Crocuses need the sun to grow, but though they adore basking in its glory all day, they can also do very well in places with partial shade or scattered sunlight.</p>
<p>To help the bulbs settle and grow roots quickly, it's important to water them well after planting, but after that you will not have to water them again.</p>
<p>After crocuses have finished blooming, do not cut the foliage straight away; through photosynthesis the leaves will create nutrients that the bulb will be needing for its next growing season.</p>
</ul>

<h2>Tips For A Healthier Plant</h2>
<li>Avoid soggy soil at all cost. This means places where you can still see puddles 5 to 6 hours after a rainstorm.</li>
<li>Crocuses will need to be planted deep enough that they will not be affected by temperature variations above ground.</li>
<li>The standard method for calculating the ideal depth is to dig a hole three times as deep as the bulb is high.</li>
<li>During blooming season, you generally do not have to water your crocuses, but you can water them when there hasn't been any rain for 3 to 5 days.</li>
