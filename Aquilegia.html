    <h1>Wondering how to grow Aquilegia?</h1>
   <img src="./picturs/Aquilegia2.jpg" alt="Aquilegia" width="100%" height="250px" style="border-radius:10px; box-shadow:0px 7px 5px #202020a5; margin-bottom:2px;">
    <p>Aquilegia are also highly attractive to hummingbirds and provide a copious supply of nature's nectar from late Spring into the Summer months. The plant has healing properties. It is applied externally in the form of herbal tea, especially against the open wounds as well as insecticide and lousicide. Aquilegia vulgaris is administered for the treatment of jaundice, kidney stones and rheumatism.</p>
        <ul> 
<h2>Steps:</h2>
<li>Step 1: Planting</li>
<p>You can plant aquilegia at any time of year, but Spring is the best time for them to establish well in most regions. Plant with a spacing of around 30cm apart from each other. </p>
<li>Step 2: Condition</li>
<p>These plants are not fussy about conditions so long as soil is fertile and not waterlogged or bone dry they will survive. They thrives in rich, moist but free draining soil (not too wet or too dry). Keep the soil of the plants moist following planting until well established. Then only weekly watering is necessary. Make sure to plant them in a sunny or semi-shaded spot. </p>
<li>Step 3: Additional Care </li>
<p>You can trim off old leaves as they start to yellow in Autumn, leaving a tight rosette of newer foliage in the centre. </p> 
  <p> Aquilegia do not need any special pruning. However, once flowering have faded you can cut the entire plant down to encourage a fresh flush of leaves. Give plants some water at this point if the soil is dry to encourage regrowth.</p>

    <h2>Tips For A Healthier Plant</h2>
    <li>Plants grown in the garden will not need feeding but you might use a general fertiliser if soil is poor. </li>
    <li>These are not long-lived plants, so consider buying a few extras each year to keep a good display going year after year. </li>
    <li>Remove dead flower heads from the plant after flowering to tidy up the plant. </li>
    <li>Although Aquilegia has no known toxicity issues with humans, care should still be taken when handling or touching this plant.</li>
