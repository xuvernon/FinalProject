    <h1>Wondering how to grow Aquilegia?</h1>
   <img src="./picturs/Aquilegia2.jpg" alt="Aquilegia" width="100%" height="250px" style="border-radius:10px; box-shadow:0px 7px 5px #202020a5; margin-bottom:2px;">
    <p>Aquilegia are also highly attractive to hummingbirds and provide a copious supply of nature's nectar from late spring into the summer months. The plant hasÂ healing properties. It is applied externally in the form of herbal tea, especially against the open wounds as well as insecticide and lousicide. Aquilegia vulgaris is administered for the treatment of jaundice, kidney stones and rheumatism.</p>
        <ul> 
<h2>steps:</h2>
<li>step 1 : planting</li>
<p>You can plant aquilegia at any time of year, but spring is the best time for them to establish well in most regions.Plant with a spacing of around 30cm from other aquilegia.Once established, plants shouldn't need watering, although a good soak after cutting back after flowering will help encourage a new flush of leaves.</p>
<li>step 2 : condition</li>
<p>Plants aren't fussy about conditions so long as soil is fertile and not waterlogged or bone dry. They thrives in rich, moist but free draining soil (not too wet or too dry). Make sure to Plant them in a sunny or semi-shaded spot </p>
<li>step 3 : additional care </li>
<p>You can trim off old leaves as they start to yellow in autumn, leaving a tight rosette of newer foliage in the centre. 
  </p> <p> Aquilegia don't need any special pruning. However, once flowering have faded you can cut the entire plant down to encourage a fresh flush of leaves. Give plants a water at this point if the soil is dry to encourage this regrowth.</p>    
</ul>

<h2>Tips For Healthier Plants</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Tip 1. It's just worth remembering that these are not long-lived plants, so it's always worth buying or growing from seed a few extras each year to keep a good display going year after year.</li>
    <li>Tip 2. Plants grown in the garden won't need feeding but you might use a general fertiliser if soil is poor.</li>
    <li>Tip 3. Deadhead after flowering to tidy up the plants. However, if you want more aquilegia, allow the seed to ripen before collecting or allowing to self seed (See Propagation section below).</li>
    <li>Tip 4. Although Aquilegia has no known toxicity issues with humans, care should still be taken when handling or touching this plant.</li>
