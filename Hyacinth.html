    <h1>Wondering how to grow Hyacinth?</h1>
   <img src="./picturs/Hyacinth2.jpeg" alt="Hyacinth" width="100%" height="250px" style="border-radius:10px; box-shadow:0px 7px 5px #202020a5; margin-bottom:2px;">
    <p>Like tulips and daffodils, hyacinths are an iconic spring flower. Their showy spikes of blooms in shades of blue, purple, white, pink, apricot and red pop up at the end of winter when you're really excited to see flowers. Best of all, hyacinth blooms last for two weeks or more, longer than other spring bulbs.</p>
        <ul> 
<h2>steps:</h2>
<li>step 1 : planting</li>
<p>Grow hyacinths in moist but well-drained soil in full sun between September and November. Spread the seeds evenly on the surface of the potting mix 10cm deep and 8cm apart, then cover the seeds with a thin layer of sand.</p>
<li>step 2 : condition</li>
<p>Keep in a dark place at temperatures above freezing but no higher than 7Â°C, for at least 10 weeks to allow roots to develop. When shoots are about 1 inch long, increase light and temperature gradually.</p>
<p> They prefer well-drained, moderately fertile soil in full sun if they are going to remain in one place for a few years. They will also tolerate partial shade for a one-off display, but they will bloom less well in the following years if left there.</p>
<li>step 3 : additional care </li>
<p>Hyacinth won't like their roots to be sopping wet, but neither will they respond well to drying out completely. As a general rule, you should check your hyacinth for dry soil every 2 to 3 days. Water it if the soil has completely dried out, but don't completely soak it.</p>  
</ul>

<h2>Tips For Healthier Plants</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Tip 1. Plant hyacinth bulbs for pot displays more shallowly and closer together, as long as they're not touching.</li>  
 <li>Tip 2. Make sure that the soil is moist not wet.</li> 
 <li>Tip 3. They are loaded with nutrients like antioxidants, minerals, and vitamins that are beneficial to the body. It may help soothe a sore throat and improve digestion. </li> 
 <li>Tip 4. The bulbs need to be pre-chilled before planting.</li> 
</ul>
